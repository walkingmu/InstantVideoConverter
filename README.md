# InstantVideoConverter
Project Owner: Yijia Xu
Project Description:
The end goal of this project is to create a hardware accelerated video converter with support up to 4K video. This project will also support embedding Metadata for video taken by spherical cameras.

This open source project is in active development stage currently. Yijia Xu is the owner of the project and currently developing and maintaining it.

The intention of this project is to create a light-weight video conversion software that
  - Hide all technical details for video conversion and convert a video with a simple click.
  - Allow user the inject metadata into videos taken by spherical cameras (such as Keymission 360).
  - Support hardware accelerated video conversion.

Licensing
- InstantVideoConverter is licensed under the MIT license
- InstantVideoConverter used referenced part code from MediaToolkit which is licensed under MIT license. 
- InstantVideoConverter uses FFmpeg, a multimedia framework which is licensed under the LGPLv2.1 license.

As is a light-weight software, it won't allow users to adjust videos in a professional way. If such professional software is needed, we suggest to consider this other open source project: HandBrake
